Launch main.py 
Enter "crawl"

Wait for a while (A couple of hours) for the bot to crawl (it most likely wouldn't fully finish for years if it ever would so don't wait for it to finish run for maybe 10-20 hours to test it)

Relaunch main.py
Enter "search" (This will take a different amount of time depending on how many pages you indexed, for me with 1000 pages indexed (Took about 6 hours to index all of them) it took about 5 minutes.

Enter your search term and get the link!

NOTE:
This is a very simple search engine, the algorithm it uses to list the sites is bad. It simply just counts how many words it finds that are in your search term and adds them up then sorts the results by that number.
